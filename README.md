# Dumbnail - The Ultimate Memeshot Maker
I created the site to be a one-stop-shop for creating *memeshots* -- a meme in the version of a screenshot. 

As of now I have YouTube thumbnails, tweets, Instagram posts, iMessage, and ChatGPT conversations. My goal is to have Dumbnail be an open source social media with feeds, user auth, etc, all for creating different kinds of memes. 

## For Starters
What makes Dumbnail unique is that it has these interesting type of memes all in one place instead of scattered about the internet. There are many other possible additions, almost too much to count, but what's cool is that they fall into only a few types of catergories:
1. Social Media Content (Thumbnails, Tweets, Posts [Insta, Reddit, LinkedIn, etc])
2. Messaging (DMs, iMessage, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, etc.)
3. Legacy Memes (Distracted Boyfriend, Change My Mind, Exit 12, etc.)
4. Unique Content (DraftKings lineups, Genius lyric cards, Stock Portfolios, etc.)

There are so many hilarious possibilities, I mean, it's almost endless. And, I know there are similiar things on the internet, but not at this capacity, or that open source. 

## Thoughts
People post memes to every social media, but most of them (if not all) aren't created there. Why not cut out the middle man? Make Dumbnail the hub for memes. Memehub...

I'm not trying to make money I just want to build something awesome. And I think Dumbnail has the potential for it, all I need is a bit of help; my coding isn't the best (the site is running at https://app.dumbnail.com on DO and works - should I just use GH pages?) and I'm slowly realizing I'm out of my league. I'v done a lot of the grunt work at the beginning and also provided a lot of vision, so no I would love others to contribute as well, to fix bugs, make sure it can scale, add features, etc.

Don't get me wrong, I'm still gonna work on it, I just don't think I can accomplish all the awesome possibilities by myself.

## Features
Here are some features I would want to add that I think will help beef up the site.
- User auth, in-app messaging, etc.
- A feed where users can post memes they created, like, comment, etc.
- - I would want a unique version of liking because I think it's sort of vague. Maybe grins/laughs to differentiate between liking and loving..
- A whole bunch of meme templates, constantly growing, etc. 

The truth is making this a social media/community isn't as important to me as having the best and biggest meme site out there, totally free. Obviously scaling might mean advertising or donations, I don't have a lot to back server costs and whatnot. I'm also not so familiar with how open source and making profit overlap, but I assume they do to some extent.

## Bugs
The only big bug right now is that downloading a screenshot doesn't work on Safari. It's something to do with the package I'm using html-to-image. I filled out an issue https://github.com/bubkoo/html-to-image/issues/348 but no one has figured out how to fix it, or if they have, I can't figure out how to implement it. 

## Contributing
New to open source, but I assume anyone who knows how to help will know how to contribute. I assume just make a pull request?

## Alas
Any help would be awesome, any contribution. I want to have fun and build something cool which is why I got into software in the first place. Even editing this README would be cool too.
