# Dumbnail - The Ultimate Memeshot Maker
I created the site to be a one-stop-shop for creating *memeshots* -- a meme in the version of a screenshot. 

As of now it has YouTube thumbnails, tweets, Instagram posts, iMessage, and ChatGPT conversations. My goal is for Dumbnail to be an open-source social media with feeds, user auth, etc, all for creating different kinds of memes. 

## For Starters
What makes Dumbnail unique is that it has these interesting type of memes all in one place instead of scattered about the internet. Plus, I think I was the first (not sure if it has since been copied) to create fake thumbnails or ChatGPT convos; for ChatGPT I had it up within the week of its release. 

There are many other possible additions as well, almost too much to count. But what's cool is that they all fall into only a few catergories of memes:
1. Social Media Content (Thumbnails, Tweets, Posts [Insta, Reddit, LinkedIn, etc])
2. Messaging (DMs, iMessage, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, etc.)
3. Legacy Memes (Distracted Boyfriend, Change My Mind, Exit 12, etc.)
4. Unique Content (DraftKings lineups, Genius lyric cards, Stock Portfolios, etc.)

## Thoughts
People post memes to every social media, but most of them (if not all) aren't created there. Why not cut out the middle man? Make Dumbnail the hub for memes. *Memehub*...?

For the record, I'm not trying to make money off this, that isn't my intention, especially now that I'm making it open source. I just want to build something really awesome with other creative people and I think Dumbnail has the potential for it. All I need is a bit of help. 

My coding isn't the best (the site is running at https://app.dumbnail.com on a DO server [should I use GH pages instead since it's free?]) and I'm slowly realizing I'm out of my league. I've done a lot of the grunt work, scaffolding and designing the basics, while also providing the vision, but now I want  others to contribute to the project as well. To fix bugs, make sure it can scale, add features, etc.

Don't get me wrong, I'm still gonna work on it, I just don't think I can accomplish all I want to do by myself.

Lastly, as someone who loves the art of the meme, but who also doesn't like the idea of fake screenshots spreading misinformation, this

## Features
Here are some features I want to add that I think will help beef up and legitamize the site.
- User auth, in-app messaging, friends, a network, etc.
- A feed where users can post memes they've created or like and comment on others' posts, etc.
- A whole bunch of templates (constantly growing) for users to create their memes. I'll leave a list of potential templates at the bottom, but feel free to create your own.

The truth is making this a social media/community isn't as important to me as having the best and biggest meme site out there. Meaning, what I care most about is Meme Integrity. If you want to add a Tumblr template, the colors, fonts, look should all be as close to the real thing as possible. 

## Bugs
The only big bug right now is that downloading a screenshot doesn't work on Safari. It's something to do with the package I'm using html-to-image. I filled out an issue https://github.com/bubkoo/html-to-image/issues/348 but no one has figured out how to fix it, or if they have, I can't figure out how to implement it. 

## Contributing
New to open source, but I assume anyone who knows how to help will know how to contribute. I assume just make a pull request?

## Alas
Any help would be awesome, any contribution. I want to have fun and build something cool which is why I got into software in the first place. Even editing this README would be cool too.
